# Architect Handover Document - Robofy Next.js with Python Backend

## Project Overview
This document provides the essential architectural requirements and specifications for the Robofy website implementation using a Next.js frontend with Python backend services. It is derived from the full PRD and UI/UX specification to focus on technical decisions and system design, with AI integration handled through Python microservices and autoblogging for content generation.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### 1. Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with App Router and React 18
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom component system
- **Backend**: Python microservices (FastAPI or Django) for AI processing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for CRM data and AI processing
- **Hosting**: Next.js on Vercel/Netlify, Python backend on cloud services (e.g., AWS Lambda, Heroku)
- **Email Services**: SMTP or Mailgun for email delivery
- **AI Integration**: Python-based APIs for automation tasks

### 2. System Architecture
```
Next.js Frontend → Static Files → Vercel/Netlify Hosting
Python Backend (FastAPI) → AI Services → Database (PostgreSQL) → Email Delivery
Autoblogging Scripts → Content Generation → Next.js Build
```

### 3. Performance Targets
- **LCP**: < 2.5 seconds
- **FID**: < 100 milliseconds
- **CLS**: < 0.1
- **TTFB**: < 200 milliseconds
- **Full site build time**: < 5 minutes
- **AI API Response Time**: < 2 seconds for 95% of requests

### 4. Security Requirements
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities in production
- HTTPS enforcement with HSTS headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS attacks
- API rate limiting and authentication using JWT tokens for service-to-service communication
- Regular security updates applied within 7 days of release
- Daily automated backups with 30-day retention

## Key Integration Points

### AI Content Integration
- Python backend services for AI content generation and processing
- Automated content generation via autoblogging scripts
- Direct file output to Next.js content directories for static site generation
- Batch processing capabilities for large content updates

### CRM and Lead Management
- Database integration for storing lead information (name, email, industry, source) accessed via Python services
- AI-powered lead scoring based on engagement and demographic data processed through Python backend
- Automated lead segmentation using AI for targeted marketing via Python algorithms
- Real-time lead sync between website forms and CRM database through Python APIs

### Email CRM Automation
- AI-driven email automation for lead nurturing sequences handled by Python services
- Personalization of email content based on lead behavior and preferences processed through Python
- Integration with email delivery services (SMTP, Mailgun) via Python backend
- Analytics and reporting on email campaign performance through Python data processing

## Content Generation via Autoblogging

### Autoblogging Approach
- **AI-Driven Content**: Python scripts generate content using AI models
- **Static Content**: Content is generated as static files (Markdown/JSON) consumed by Next.js at build time
- **Automation**: Scheduled runs for regular content updates via cron jobs or workflow triggers
- **No CMS Overhead**: Eliminates need for content management systems

### Content Structure
- **Content Types**: Industry pages, services, testimonials, case studies, blog posts as static files
- **File Formats**: Markdown or JSON files for easy integration with Next.js
- **Build Triggers**: CI/CD pipelines trigger rebuilds on content updates

### AI Content Integration
- Python backend services handle all content generation
- Direct file output to Next.js content directories
- No moderation workflow needed as AI generates final content
- Batch processing capabilities for large content updates

## Frontend Architecture

### Design System
- Custom Tailwind CSS-based system with extensions for futuristic aesthetics
- Support for light/dark modes with mode toggle integration
- Component library including buttons, navigation, cards, and form elements

### Responsive Strategy
- **Breakpoints**:
  - Mobile: 320px - 767px
  - Tablet: 768px - 1023px
  - Desktop: 1024px - 1439px
  - Wide: 1440px+
- **Adaptation Patterns**: Stack on mobile, hybrid on tablet, horizontal on desktop

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for 3D scenes and images
- Progressive enhancement for 3D elements
- Optimized assets (WebP, compressed 3D models)
- Critical CSS inlining
- Resource hinting (preload, preconnect)
- Caching strategy with CDN

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- Next.js project setup with Tailwind CSS
- Python backend setup with FastAPI/Django
- Basic component library and design system
- Initial API integration between Next.js and Python backend

### Phase 2: Core Pages (3-4 weeks)
- Homepage implementation with static generation
- Industry page templates and content integration via autoblogging
- Service pages and pricing structures
- Form handling and basic CRM integration via Python backend

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)
- AI integration with Python backend services
- Database setup for CRM lead storage accessed via Python
- Email CRM integration and automation through Python services
- Performance optimization and caching strategy
- Analytics and tracking implementation
- Security hardening and deployment setup

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- Conversion Rate: >5% visitor to lead conversion
- Performance Scores: >90 Lighthouse score
- Cost Efficiency: < $60/month total hosting and maintenance
- Content Throughput: New industry pages added via autoblogging within 1 day
