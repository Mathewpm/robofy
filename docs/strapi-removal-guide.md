# Strapi CMS Removal Guide - Transition to Python Autoblogging

## Overview
This document provides instructions for removing the Strapi CMS and transitioning to the Python-based autoblogging system as specified in the architect handover document. The architect's decision mandates a "No CMS Overhead" approach with AI-driven content generation via Python scripts.

## Why Remove Strapi?
- **Architect's Decision**: The [`architect-handover.md`](docs/architect-handover.md:63-77) explicitly specifies "No CMS Overhead" and an "Autoblogging Approach" using Python backend services.
- **Performance**: Eliminates CMS database overhead and simplifies content management.
- **AI Integration**: Python backend better supports AI content generation and processing.
- **Cost Reduction**: Removes the need for CMS hosting and maintenance.

## Steps for Strapi Removal

### 1. Backup Existing Data (If Needed)
```bash
# Backup Strapi database if you have existing content
# This step is optional since we're transitioning to autogenerated content
cp -r strapi/ strapi-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
```

### 2. Remove Strapi Directory
```bash
# Remove the entire Strapi CMS directory
rm -rf strapi/
```

### 3. Update Project Dependencies
Remove Strapi-related dependencies from [`package.json`](package.json:1) if they exist (though they're in a separate package.json).

### 4. Verify Removal
Ensure the `strapi/` directory is completely removed from the project structure.

## New Python Autoblogging System

### Architecture
- **Python Backend**: FastAPI application in [`backend/main.py`](backend/main.py:1)
- **Autoblogging Script**: Content generation in [`backend/autoblogging.py`](backend/autoblogging.py:1)
- **Content Storage**: Static files in `src/content/` for Next.js consumption

### Key Features
- AI-generated content for multiple industries (beauty, dental, healthcare, retail, fitness, solar)
- Automated content creation without CMS overhead
- Direct integration with Next.js static generation
- RESTful APIs for lead management and content generation

### Running the New System

#### Start Development Servers
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev

# Or start separately
npm run dev:frontend  # Next.js on port 3000
npm run dev:backend   # Python FastAPI on port 8000
```

#### Generate Content
```bash
# Run autoblogging to generate content
npm run generate:content

# Generated files will be in src/content/
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `POST /api/leads` - Create new leads
- `GET /api/leads` - List all leads
- `POST /api/ai/content` - Generate AI content
- `GET /api/content` - List generated content

## Content Migration
Since we're moving from Strapi to autogenerated content:
1. Existing Strapi content will not be migrated (by design)
2. New content will be generated automatically via Python scripts
3. Content is stored as Markdown files in `src/content/`
4. Next.js will rebuild when new content is generated

## Validation
After removal, verify:
1. ✅ Strapi directory is removed
2. ✅ Python backend starts successfully (`npm run dev:backend`)
3. ✅ Content generation works (`npm run generate:content`)
4. ✅ Next.js builds with new content (`npm run build`)
5. ✅ All API endpoints are functional

## Fallback Plan
If issues arise with the new system:
1. Restore from backup: `cp -r strapi-backup-*/ strapi/`
2. Revert `package.json` changes if necessary
3. Continue using Strapi temporarily while debugging

## Support
For questions or issues with the transition:
- Refer to [`architect-handover.md`](docs/architect-handover.md:1)
- Check Python backend logs
- Review generated content in `src/content/`

*This transition aligns with the architectural decisions made in the handover document and enables scalable AI-driven content generation.*
