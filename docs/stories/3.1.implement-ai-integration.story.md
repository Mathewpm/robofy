# Story 3.1: Implement AI Integration for Content Push

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** content manager at Robofy,
**I want** to automatically generate and manage AI content through Python backend services,
**so that** we can maintain fresh, relevant content without manual intervention and enhance our SEO performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Python backend service setup with FastAPI/Django for AI processing
2. ✅ REST API endpoints for AI content generation and processing
3. ✅ Integration between Next.js frontend and Python backend via secure APIs
4. ✅ Comprehensive error handling with detailed scenarios, logging, and recovery mechanisms for AI API failures
5. ✅ Content moderation and quality checks implemented
6. ✅ Performance monitoring with specific targets (under 2s response time, 99.9% uptime) for AI integration endpoints

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Research and select AI content generation API (e.g., OpenAI, GPT-based services)
- [ ] Set up Python project structure with virtual environment and FastAPI/Django
- [ ] Implement AI model integration endpoints in Python backend (e.g., content generation, lead scoring)
- [ ] Create API documentation and client libraries for Next.js integration
- [ ] Add authentication (e.g., JWT tokens) for service-to-service communication
- [ ] Implement content scheduling system using cron jobs or similar
- [ ] Implement content moderation checks to ensure quality and appropriateness
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling with detailed scenarios and retry mechanisms for API failures
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring with specific targets and dashboards
- [ ] Set up feature flags for controlled rollout of AI content generation
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring for AI content generation activities
- [ ] Test AI content generation with various prompts and scenarios
- [ ] Verify content generation and integration with Next.js frontend
- [ ] Ensure compliance with AI API usage policies and rate limits
- [ ] Document API integration and usage guidelines
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and security measures for APIs

## Dev Notes

### Technical Specifications from Architect Handover
- **AI Integration**: Python backend services for AI processing [Source: architect-handover.md#AI Integration]
- **API Communication**: Secure REST APIs between Next.js and Python backend [Source: architect-handover.md#API Integration]
- **Performance**: Efficient API calls with caching where appropriate [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Targets]

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Automation**: Fully automated content push with minimal manual intervention [Source: jamstack-website-prd.md#Content Management]
- **Quality Control**: Content moderation to maintain brand voice and quality [Source: jamstack-website-prd.md#Content Quality]

### API Integration Requirements
- **API Selection**: Choose reliable AI content generation API with good documentation [Source: architect-handover.md#API Integration]
- **Authentication**: Secure API key management and authentication [Source: architect-handover.md#Security Measures]
- **Rate Limiting**: Adhere to API rate limits and implement retry logic [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Considerations]

### Performance Considerations
- **Performance Budget**:
  - AI API response time: < 2 seconds for 95% of requests
  - Content generation throughput: 10+ articles per hour
  - Uptime SLA: 99.9% for AI integration endpoints
  - Error rate: < 1% of total requests
- **Async Processing**: Use background jobs and message queues (Redis/Bull) for content generation to avoid blocking [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Considerations]
- **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for AI responses with 1-hour TTL to reduce API calls and costs [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Considerations]
- **Monitoring**: Track API response times, error rates, and cost metrics with detailed dashboards [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Monitoring]
- **Load Testing**: Conduct load testing to ensure system handles peak traffic (100+ concurrent content generations)

### Security Requirements
- **API Key Protection**: Secure storage of AI API keys using environment variables [Source: architect-handover.md#Security Measures]
- **Content Moderation**: Prevent inappropriate or low-quality content publication [Source: architect-handover.md#Security Measures]
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure no sensitive data is sent to AI APIs [Source: architect-handover.md#Security Measures]

### Error Handling Requirements
- **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff with jitter for API failures (max 3 retries) [Source: architect-handover.md#Error Handling]
- **Fallback Content**: Have predefined fallback content templates for common scenarios in case of AI service outages [Source: architect-handover.md#Error Handling]
- **Alerting**: Set up real-time alerts (Slack/Email) for critical failures and degradation in content generation [Source: architect-handover.md#Monitoring]
- **Error Scenarios**: Handle specific error cases:
  - API rate limiting (429 errors)
  - Authentication failures (401/403 errors)
  - Network timeouts (30s timeout)
  - Content moderation rejections
  - Invalid response formats from AI API
  - Database connection failures during content storage
- **Circuit Breaker**: Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures during AI API downtime
- **Logging**: Detailed logging with request/response tracing for debugging and audit purposes

### File Locations
- Python backend services: `backend/` directory with FastAPI/Django structure
- AI integration utilities: `src/lib/ai-integration.ts` for frontend API clients
- API routes: `src/app/api/ai/` for frontend proxy endpoints to Python backend
- Cron jobs: `backend/scripts/ai-content-cron.py` for scheduled tasks
- Types: `src/types/ai.ts` for TypeScript definitions

### Testing Standards
- API integration testing with mock responses
- Content generation quality testing
- Error handling and retry logic testing
- Performance testing under load
- Security testing for API key exposure
- End-to-end testing of content push workflow

### Integration Points
- Integration with Python backend APIs for content generation and processing
- Connection to PostgreSQL database for content storage and retrieval (accessed via Python services)
- Future integration with analytics (Google Analytics/Piano) for content performance tracking
- Potential integration with email CRM (SendGrid) for content notifications and lead nurturing
- Feature flag integration (LaunchDarkly or similar) for gradual rollout of AI features
