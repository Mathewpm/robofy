# Story 3.4: Implement Automated Backup and Recovery Procedures

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator at Robofy,
**I want** automated backup and recovery procedures for all critical systems,
**so that** we can quickly restore services in case of data loss or system failures.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Automated daily backups configured for PostgreSQL database
2. ✅ Backup procedures for Strapi CMS content and media files
3. ✅ Backup procedures for Next.js application code and configuration
4. ✅ Encrypted off-site storage for backup files
5. ✅ Automated recovery testing procedures implemented
6. ✅ Monitoring and alerting for backup failures
7. ✅ Documentation for manual recovery procedures

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Set up daily PostgreSQL backups using pg_dump or similar tool
- [ ] Implement backup rotation policy (keep 7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly backups)
- [ ] Configure backup encryption for data security
- [ ] Set up off-site storage using AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or similar
- [ ] Automate Strapi CMS content and media backups
- [ ] Backup application code and configuration files
- [ ] Implement backup verification checks
- [ ] Create automated recovery testing scripts
- [ ] Set up monitoring for backup job failures
- [ ] Document step-by-step recovery procedures
- [ ] Test full system recovery from backups
- [ ] Ensure compliance with data retention policies

## Dev Notes

### Technical Specifications from Architect Handover
- **Database**: PostgreSQL backup using pg_dump with compression [Source: architect-handover.md#Database Setup]
- **Storage**: Off-site cloud storage for backup files [Source: architect-handover.md#Infrastructure Services]
- **Security**: Encryption for backup files at rest and in transit [Source: architect-handover.md#Security Measures]

### Backup Strategy Requirements
- **Frequency**: Daily full backups with incremental options if needed
- **Retention**: 7 days daily, 4 weeks weekly, 12 months monthly
- **Verification**: Automated checks to ensure backup integrity
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 4 hours for full system recovery
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 24 hours data loss

### Security Requirements
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for all backup files
- **Access Control**: Strict access controls to backup storage
- **Audit Logging**: Log all backup and recovery operations
- **Compliance**: Meet GDPR and other regulatory requirements for data protection

### Performance Considerations
- **Backup Window**: Schedule backups during low-traffic periods
- **Storage Optimization**: Use compression and deduplication where possible
- **Network Impact**: Minimize bandwidth usage during backup operations

### File Locations
- Backup scripts: `scripts/backup/`
- Configuration files: `config/backup/`
- Recovery documentation: `docs/backup-recovery.md`
- Monitoring configuration: `config/monitoring/`

### Testing Standards
- Backup job success/failure testing
- Backup file integrity verification
- Recovery procedure testing
- Performance testing under load
- Security testing for backup access

### Integration Points
- Integration with PostgreSQL database for backups
- Connection to cloud storage services
- Integration with monitoring systems for alerts
- Future integration with disaster recovery plans
