# Story 1.3: Setup Strapi CMS

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** content editor,
**I want** Strapi CMS installed and configured with basic content types,
**so that** I can manage content for the Robofy website through an intuitive admin interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Strapi CMS deployed on VPS with production configuration
2. ✅ Basic content types created: Industry pages, services, testimonials, case studies, blog posts
3. ✅ Role-based access control configured for administrators, editors, and authors
4. ✅ Media library configured with image optimization and upload capabilities
5. ✅ API endpoints exposed with comprehensive error handling and rate limiting for Next.js frontend to consume content
6. ✅ Webhook support enabled with retry logic and failure handling for build triggers on content updates

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Install Strapi CMS on the VPS using Node.js and PM2
- [x] Configure environment variables for database connection and admin panel
- [x] Create content types based on architect specifications:
  - [x] Industry pages (beauty, dental, healthcare, retail, fitness, solar)
  - [x] Services
  - [x] Testimonials
  - [x] Case studies
  - [x] Blog posts
- [x] Set up role-based access control with permissions
- [x] Configure media library with error handling for upload failures and image optimization
- [x] Enable webhook support with retry mechanisms and failure alerts for content update notifications
- [x] Test API endpoints with comprehensive error scenarios from Next.js development environment (local tests implemented)
- [x] Secure admin panel with strong authentication, brute force protection, and session management
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring for API response times and database queries
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation including API endpoints, error codes, and troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring for CMS activities and security events

## Dev Notes

### Technical Specifications from Architect Handover
- **CMS**: Strapi self-hosted with open-source architecture [Source: architect-handover.md#CMS Structure]
- **Content Types**: Industry pages, services, testimonials, case studies, blog posts [Source: architect-handover.md#CMS Structure]
- **API Endpoints**: REST or GraphQL based on CMS capabilities [Source: architect-handover.md#CMS Structure]
- **Webhook Support**: For build triggers on content updates [Source: architect-handover.md#AI Integration FRs]

### Required Configuration
- **Database Connection**: PostgreSQL configured in Strapi database settings
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/strapi`
  - `NODE_ENV=production`
  - `HOST=0.0.0.0`
  - `PORT=1337`
- **Content Types**: Define with appropriate fields (title, content, slug, metadata, etc.)
- **Roles**: Administrator, Editor, Author with appropriate permissions

### API Endpoints
- **Content API**: `/api/{content-type}` (e.g., `/api/industry-pages`) with pagination and filtering
- **Media API**: `/api/upload` for file uploads with size validation and type restrictions
- **Admin API**: `/admin` for management interface with secure access controls
- **Webhooks**: Configure to POST to `/api/rebuild` on content changes with retry logic
- **Health Check**: `/api/health` for monitoring CMS status and performance
- **Metrics**: `/api/metrics` for performance and usage statistics (optional)

### Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: Strong admin passwords, multi-factor authentication, and session timeout policies
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement on API endpoints to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
- **CORS**: Strictly configured for Next.js domain with allowed methods and headers
- **Backups**: Regular encrypted backups of Strapi data and media with off-site storage
- **Security Headers**: Implement CSP, XSS protection, and other security headers
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular dependency updates and security audits
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control with principle of least privilege

### File Locations
- Strapi application: `/var/www/strapi/`
- Configuration files: `/var/www/strapi/config/`
- Content types: `/var/www/strapi/src/api/`
- Media uploads: `/var/www/strapi/public/uploads/`

### Testing Standards
- **API Testing**: Verify content types are accessible via API with error handling tests
- **Media Testing**: Test media upload functionality with various file types and size limits
- **Security Testing**: Confirm role-based access controls, authentication, and authorization
- **Webhook Testing**: Validate webhook triggers with retry logic and failure scenarios
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure API responses meet performance targets (<500ms response time)
- **Error Handling Testing**: Test API failures, database connection issues, and invalid requests
- **Compatibility Testing**: Ensure API responses are properly formatted for Next.js consumption
