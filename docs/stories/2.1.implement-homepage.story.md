# Story 2.1: Implement Homepage with Spline 3D Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** website visitor,
**I want** to see an immersive, futuristic homepage with interactive 3D elements,
**so that** I can get a strong first impression of Robofy's AI-powered services and easily navigate to key sections.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Homepage built with Next.js static generation for optimal performance
2. ✅ Full-viewport Spline 3D scene integrated with responsive design
3. ✅ Dynamic overlay with clear value proposition and call-to-action
4. ✅ Mode toggle in navigation with glow effect functionality
5. ✅ Responsive design that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
6. ✅ Fast loading times with performance budget: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1, and optimized assets

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create homepage component in `src/app/page.tsx` with static generation
- [ ] Integrate Spline 3D scene using @spline/react library
- [ ] Implement responsive full-viewport layout for 3D scene
- [ ] Add dynamic overlay with value proposition text and CTA button
- [ ] Ensure 3D scene responds to scroll and cursor movement
- [ ] Optimize 3D assets for web (compressed models, WebP textures)
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for 3D scene to improve LCP
- [ ] Add progressive enhancement for 3D elements (fallback for slow devices)
- [ ] Integrate with navigation component including mode toggle
- [ ] Test performance across devices and network conditions with Lighthouse CI
- [ ] Verify Lighthouse scores meet performance budget targets (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)
- [ ] Implement error handling for 3D scene load failures and image loading errors
- [ ] Add performance monitoring with real-user metrics (RUM) integration

## Dev Notes

### Technical Specifications from Architect Handover
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router and static generation [Source: architect-handover.md#Core Architectural Decisions]
- **Performance**: LCP < 2.5 seconds, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1 [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Targets]
- **3D Integration**: Spline 3D for immersive hero sections [Source: front-end-spec.md#Homepage Hero Section]

### UI/UX Requirements from Frontend Spec
- **Hero Section**: Full-viewport Spline 3D animation with dynamic overlay [Source: front-end-spec.md#Homepage Hero Section]
- **Value Proposition**: Clear messaging about AI-powered digital marketing [Source: front-end-spec.md#Homepage Hero Section]
- **Interaction**: 3D scene responds to scroll and cursor movement [Source: front-end-spec.md#Homepage Hero Section]
- **Mode Toggle**: Glow effect integration in navigation [Source: front-end-spec.md#Homepage Hero Section]

### Performance Considerations
- **Performance Budget**:
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5 seconds
  - First Input Delay (FID): < 100 milliseconds
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
  - Time to First Byte (TTFB): < 200 milliseconds
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement for 3D scenes and images with intersection observer [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Considerations]
- **Asset Optimization**: WebP format with fallbacks, compressed 3D models (GLTF/GLB), responsive images [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Considerations]
- **Critical CSS**: Inlining for above-the-fold content with purgeCSS for unused styles [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Considerations]
- **Resource Hinting**: Preload critical resources, preconnect to third-party domains, DNS-prefetch [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Considerations]
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement service worker for static assets, CDN for global distribution [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Considerations]
- **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting, tree shaking, and minimal JavaScript bundles [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Considerations]

### Spline 3D Integration
- Use `@spline/react` package for React integration
- Scene should be loaded from Spline design file
- Implement error handling for 3D load failures
- Add loading states for better user experience

### Responsive Design Requirements
- **Breakpoints**: Mobile (320-767px), Tablet (768-1023px), Desktop (1024-1439px), Wide (1440px+) [Source: front-end-spec.md#Breakpoints]
- **Adaptation**: Stack content on mobile, hybrid on tablet, horizontal on desktop [Source: front-end-spec.md#Adaptation Patterns]
- **Touch Optimization**: Ensure interactive elements work on touch devices [Source: front-end-spec.md#Responsiveness Strategy]

### Accessibility Requirements
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Compliance for all interactive elements [Source: front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]
- **Alternative Text**: For 3D elements and images [Source: front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Support for all interactive elements [Source: front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]
- **Focus Indicators**: High contrast for keyboard users [Source: front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]

### File Locations
- Homepage component: `src/app/page.tsx`
- Spline integration: `src/components/SplineScene.tsx`
- Styles: `src/styles/homepage.css` for specific styles
- Public assets: `public/3d-models/` for 3D assets

### Testing Standards
- **Performance Testing**: Lighthouse CI integration, WebPageTest benchmarks, and Core Web Vitals monitoring
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge with backward compatibility checks
- **Mobile Device Testing**: iOS and Android on various devices and network conditions (3G/4G)
- **Accessibility Testing**: Screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver), keyboard navigation, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Load Testing**: Stress testing under slow network conditions (Slow 3G) and high traffic scenarios
- **Error Handling Testing**:
  - 3D scene load failures with fallback content
  - Image loading errors with placeholder handling
  - API failure scenarios for dynamic content
  - Network connectivity issues with offline capabilities

### Integration Points
- Integration with navigation component for mode toggle
- Connection to Tailwind CSS design system
- Future integration with CMS for dynamic content
- Analytics tracking for user interactions
