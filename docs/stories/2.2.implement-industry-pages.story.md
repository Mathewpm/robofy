- **CMS Integration**: Strapi CMS for content management [Source: architect-handover.md#CMS Integration]
- **API Consumption**: REST or GraphQL APIs for content fetching [Source: architect-handover.md#API Integration]

### UI/UX Requirements from Frontend Spec
- **Industry Pages**: Tailored content for each industry with specific case studies [Source: front-end-spec.md#Industry Pages]
- **Hero Sections**: Industry-specific messaging and imagery [Source: front-end-spec.md#Industry Pages]
- **Content Structure**: Consistent layout with variations for industry context [Source: front-end-spec.md#Industry Pages]

### Content Management Requirements

### Performance Considerations
- **Performance Budget**:
  - Page load time: < 3 seconds for 95% of requests
  - API response time: < 500ms for CMS content fetching
  - Image optimization: WebP format with fallbacks, lazy loading
- **Incremental Static Regeneration**: For dynamic industry pages with 24-hour revalidation [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Considerations]
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement Redis caching for CMS API responses with 1-hour TTL [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Considerations]
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with optimized formats and responsive sizes [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Considerations]
- **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting for industry-specific components to reduce initial load

### SEO Requirements
- **Meta Tags**: Dynamic title, description, and Open Graph tags per industry [Source: front-end-spec.md#SEO Requirements]
- **Structured Data**: Schema.org markup for local business and service areas [Source: front-end-spec.md#SEO Requirements]
- **Canonical URLs**: Proper implementation for dynamic pages [Source: front-end-spec.md#SEO Requirements]

### Responsive Design Requirements
- **Breakpoints**: Mobile (320-767px), Tablet (768-1023px), Desktop (1024-1439px), Wide (1440px+) [Source: front-end-spec.md#Breakpoints]
- **Adaptation**: Consistent content structure with responsive typography and spacing [Source: front-end-spec.md#Adaptation Patterns]
- **Touch Optimization**: Touch-friendly navigation and interactive elements [Source: front-end-spec.md#Responsiveness Strategy]

### Accessibility Requirements
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Compliance for all content and interactive elements [Source: front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full support for dynamic content [Source: front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML [Source: front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]

### File Locations
- Industry page template: `src/app/industries/[industry]/page.tsx`
- API utilities: `src/lib/strapi.ts` for CMS integration
- Components: `src/components/industry/` for industry-specific components
- Types: `src/types/industry.ts` for TypeScript definitions

### Testing Standards
- **Dynamic Routing Testing**: Test with various industry slugs including invalid slugs and error handling
- **CMS Integration Testing**: Content fetching with error scenarios (network failures, invalid responses)
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing under slow network conditions and measurement against performance budgets
- **Responsive Design Testing**: Across devices with emphasis on touch interactions and accessibility
- **SEO Validation**: Using tools like Google Rich Results Test with structured data verification
- **Accessibility Testing**: Screen readers, keyboard navigation, and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Error Handling Testing**:
  - 404 pages for invalid industry slugs
  - API failure fallback UI
  - Image loading errors with placeholders
  - Component-level error boundaries

### Integration Points
- Integration with Strapi CMS API
- Connection to component library for consistent UI
- Future integration with analytics for page tracking
- Connection to form handling for lead capture with error handling integration
- Integration with monitoring tools for performance and error tracking
