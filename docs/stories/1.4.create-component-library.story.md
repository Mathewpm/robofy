# Story 1.4: Create Component Library and Design System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** frontend developer,
**I want** a reusable component library and design system based on Tailwind CSS,
**so that** I can consistently build UI elements across the Robofy website with futuristic aesthetics.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Tailwind CSS custom configuration with extended design tokens for futuristic theme
2. ✅ Core component library created: buttons, navigation, cards, form elements
3. ✅ Light/dark mode support implemented with mode toggle component
4. ✅ Responsive design utilities configured for all breakpoints
5. ✅ Component documentation with usage examples, variants, and error handling guidelines
6. ✅ Design system tokens (colors, typography, spacing) defined and consistent with performance optimizations

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Extend Tailwind CSS configuration with custom design tokens:
  - [ ] Define color palette with primary, accent, and neutral colors
  - [ ] Set up typography scale with Inter font family
  - [ ] Configure spacing scale with 8px increments
  - [ ] Add custom utilities for futuristic effects (glows, gradients)
- [ ] Create core component library in `src/components/`:
  - [ ] Button component with primary, secondary, and ghost variants
  - [ ] Navigation component with desktop and mobile variants
  - [ ] Card component for content containers
  - [ ] Form components (input, textarea, select, checkbox, radio)
  - [ ] Mode toggle component for light/dark theme switching
- [ ] Implement light/dark mode support:
  - [ ] CSS custom properties for theme variables
  - [ ] Mode persistence using localStorage
  - [ ] Smooth transitions between themes
- [ ] Configure responsive design utilities:
  - [ ] Breakpoints for mobile, tablet, desktop, and wide screens
  - [ ] Responsive variants for all components
- [ ] Create component documentation with usage examples and error handling guidelines:
  - [ ] Storybook or similar documentation setup with interactive examples
  - [ ] Usage examples for each component variant including error states
  - [ ] Props documentation, default values, and validation rules
  - [ ] Error boundary implementation guidelines for components
- [ ] Test components across different browsers and devices with error scenario testing
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations: lazy loading, memoization, and bundle splitting for components
- [ ] Add accessibility error handling and ARIA labels for screen readers
- [ ] Integrate components into basic layout structure with error boundaries

### Technical Specifications from Architect Handover
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom component system [Source: architect-handover.md#Core Architectural Decisions]
- **Design System**: Custom Tailwind CSS-based system with extensions for futuristic aesthetics [Source: architect-handover.md#Frontend Architecture]
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Support for light/dark modes with mode toggle integration [Source: architect-handover.md#Design System]
- **Responsive Strategy**: Breakpoints for mobile, tablet, desktop, and wide screens [Source: architect-handover.md#Responsive Strategy]

### Design System Requirements from UI/UX Spec
- **Color Palette**: Primary background #000000/#FFFFFF, Accent colors #007BFF, #00FF00, #00FFFF [Source: front-end-spec.md#Color Palette]
- **Typography**: Inter font family with type scale (H1: 2.5rem, H2: 2rem, etc.) [Source: front-end-spec.md#Typography]
- **Spacing**: 8px increments (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.) [Source: front-end-spec.md#Spacing & Layout]
- **Breakpoints**: Mobile (320-767px), Tablet (768-1023px), Desktop (1024-1439px), Wide (1440px+) [Source: front-end-spec.md#Breakpoints]

### Component Specifications
- **Buttons**: Primary (vibrant accents), Secondary (outline), Ghost (minimal) variants [Source: front-end-spec.md#Button Component]
- **Navigation**: Horizontal menu with dropdowns on desktop, hamburger on mobile [Source: front-end-spec.md#Navigation Component]
- **Forms**: Input fields with futuristic styling and validation states [Source: front-end-spec.md#Form Components]
- **Cards**: Container for content snippets and showcases [Source: front-end-spec.md#Card Component]

### File Locations
- Tailwind config: `tailwind.config.js`
- Component directory: `src/components/`
  - `Button.tsx`
  - `Navigation.tsx`
  - `Card.tsx`
  - `Form/` directory with input components
  - `ThemeToggle.tsx`
- Styles directory: `src/styles/` for global CSS
- Documentation: `docs/components/` or Storybook setup

### Testing Standards
- **Unit Testing**: Components should be unit tested with React Testing Library including error state tests
- **Responsiveness Testing**: Test across breakpoints with edge cases and overflow scenarios
- **Accessibility Testing**: Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Error Handling Testing**: Test component error boundaries, invalid prop handling, and fallback UI
- **Performance Testing**: Measure render times, memory usage, and bundle impact of components
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensure compatibility with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- **Theme Testing**: Verify theme switching functionality and consistency across variants

### Integration Points
- Components should integrate with Next.js App Router and error boundary patterns
- Support for TypeScript props and interfaces with strict validation
- Compatibility with Tailwind CSS classes and custom utilities
- Theme context for light/dark mode management with fallback themes
- Error logging integration for component-level errors
- Performance monitoring integration for component load times
