# Story 3.2: Setup CRM Database for Lead Management

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** business development manager at Robofy,
**I want** a robust database system accessed through Python backend services to store and manage lead information from website forms,
**so that** we can efficiently track potential clients, follow up on inquiries, and analyze lead conversion rates.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ PostgreSQL database configured with CRM schema
2. ✅ Lead data model implemented with all necessary fields
3. ✅ Python backend API endpoints for CRUD operations on lead data
4. ✅ Integration with form handling for automatic lead capture via Python services
5. ✅ Data validation and sanitization implemented in Python backend
6. ✅ Backup and recovery procedures established

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design database schema for CRM leads in PostgreSQL
- [ ] Create lead table with fields: id, name, email, phone, company, industry, service_interest, message, status, created_at, updated_at
- [ ] Set up database connection pooling for performance in Python backend
- [ ] Implement data access layer in Python backend using SQLAlchemy or similar ORM
- [ ] Create Python backend API endpoints for lead creation, reading, updating, and deletion
- [ ] Integrate with form submission handling to automatically store leads via Python APIs (must be completed before Story 2.4 implementation)
- [ ] Implement data validation rules for lead fields in Python backend
- [ ] Add sanitization to prevent SQL injection and other attacks in Python backend
- [ ] Set up database backups using pg_dump or similar
- [ ] Test database operations with various data scenarios
- [ ] Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.)
- [ ] Document database schema and API usage

## Dev Notes

### Technical Specifications from Architect Handover
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for CRM data storage [Source: architect-handover.md#Database Setup]
- **API Integration**: Python backend REST APIs for data operations [Source: architect-handover.md#API Integration]
- **Security**: Data protection and injection prevention in Python backend [Source: architect-handover.md#Security Measures]

### Data Model Requirements
- **Lead Fields**: Contact info, company details, service interests, submission details [Source: architect-handover.md#CRM Integration]
- **Status Tracking**: Lead status (new, contacted, qualified, closed) [Source: architect-handover.md#CRM Integration]
- **Timestamps**: Created and updated timestamps for auditing [Source: architect-handover.md#CRM Integration]

### Performance Considerations
- **Indexing**: Add indexes on frequently queried fields (email, status, created_at) [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Considerations]
- **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling to handle multiple requests efficiently [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Considerations]
- **Query Optimization**: Ensure queries are optimized for performance [Source: architect-handover.md#Performance Targets]

### Security Requirements
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries or ORM [Source: architect-handover.md#Security Measures]
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest if required [Source: architect-handover.md#Security Measures]
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access to lead data [Source: architect-handover.md#Security Measures]

### Compliance Requirements
- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensure right to be forgotten and data portability [Source: architect-handover.md#Compliance]
- **Data Retention**: Policies for data retention and deletion [Source: architect-handover.md#Compliance]
- **Audit Logging**: Log access and changes to lead data [Source: architect-handover.md#Compliance]

### File Locations
- Database configuration: `backend/database.py` or similar in Python backend
- Data models: `backend/models/lead.py` in Python backend
- API routes: `backend/api/leads.py` for lead management endpoints in Python
- Migration scripts: `backend/migrations/` for database schema changes
- Frontend API clients: `src/lib/api/leads.ts` for Next.js to call Python backend

### Testing Standards
- Database connection testing
- CRUD operation testing
- Data validation testing
- Security testing for SQL injection
- Performance testing under load
- Backup and recovery testing

### Integration Points
- Integration with form handling for lead capture via Python backend APIs (this story must be completed before Story 2.4)
- Future integration with email CRM for follow-ups through Python services
- Connection to analytics for lead conversion tracking via Python backend
- Potential integration with admin dashboard for lead management through Python APIs
